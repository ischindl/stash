"""Plugin asset templates shipped with stashai.

Each agent directory mirrors `plugins/<agent>-plugin/` in the source repo.
`stash connect` reads these to install hook configs into `~/.<agent>/` without
requiring the user to clone the stash repo.

Current agents: claude, codex, cursor, gemini, openclaw, opencode, pi.
The source-of-truth is `plugins/<agent>-plugin/`; a drift test in
`plugins/tests/test_assets_in_sync.py` keeps the two identical.
