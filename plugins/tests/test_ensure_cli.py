"""Cover the CLI floor check that Claude Code's SessionStart hook runs first.

The Claude plugin auto-updates through the marketplace while the CLI does not,
so a plugin release can land on a machine whose CLI is too old to run
`stash hook run claude`. That happened: the plugin pinned users to CLI 0.1.314,
a later plugin required 0.1.318, and because the only upgrade call site lived
*inside* the scripts the old CLI refused to execute, no machine could recover on
its own. ensure_cli.sh is the fix — the one upgrade path a stale install can
still reach — so these tests pin the properties that make it work.
