# Stash

You have the `stash` CLI on your PATH. Run `stash --help` to see commands. Use it to read transcripts, pages, and history from your Stash.

Your activity in this repo is streamed to your Stash, so your agents and you can see what you're working on across sessions.

## What a Skill is

<!-- stash:skill-model -->
A Skill is a *special folder* — one containing a SKILL.md — holding related artifacts
(pages, files, tables) that shares like any folder and gains a public URL when
published. Use one when you're publishing a *collection* of related things together — a
project writeup with its supporting files, a research thread with its sources, a session
transcript frozen as a page plus the files it produced.

A Skill is **not** a wrapper to slap on every single file you happen to share. One-item Skills
clutter Discover and defeat the model. Pick the right tool:

- Share a single file or a folder/project → `stash upload <path> --json`, hand over `app_url` (no Skill).
- Publishing a curated bundle → `stash upload <path> --skill "<title>" --json`.
- Creating a fresh skill → `stash skills create "<name>" --description "<what it holds>" --public --json`.
- Share a coding session → `stash share` (this one), or `stash share --session "<title>"` for another.

Run `stash prompts agent-guidance` to reprint this rule mid-session.

Common reads (all support `--json`):
- `stash search "<query>"` — full-text search across transcripts
- `stash vfs "cat '/me/sessions/_index.jsonl'"` — recent events
- `stash sessions agents` — who's been active
- `stash vfs "find /me -name '*.md'"` — your pages
