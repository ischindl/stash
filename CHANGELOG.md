# Changelog

This file tracks user-visible changes. v0 is the open-source baseline —
everything before it is captured in git history (`git log`), not here.

## Unreleased

- The `stash` CLI restores its machine-readable output contract for AI agent
  consumers. `stash --json <command>` now works globally on any command (OR'd
  with each command's own `--json`) and stdout carries only parseable data; all
  human-facing errors, progress, and empty-state notices print on stderr.
  Errors are classified instead of flattened: 0 = success, 1 = user/auth-style
  error (bad input, 4xx), 2 = usage or internal error (missing/unknown
  arguments, transport failure, 5xx), with 20 reserved for future agent
  signals; under `--json` a failure emits a single-line
  `{"error": {"status_code", "detail", "class"}}` envelope on stderr and never
  a traceback. A misspelled command or wrong argument now appends a one-line
  `Hint:` on stderr with a Did-you-mean suggestion or a pointer to that
  command's `--help`; stdout and `--json` output are never affected. Mutating
  commands that change nothing (`connect`, `disconnect`, `rm`, `restore`,
  `skills follow`) exit 0 honestly as `{"ok": true, "changed": false}` instead
  of reporting ad-hoc prose or an error. The CLI's own test suite gained a
  coverage gate so this contract cannot silently rot again.
- Cancelling a `stash` command is now a clean exit instead of a crash report.
  Answering `n` to a confirmation prompt, or pressing Ctrl-C at a prompt, while
  a command works, or during startup, prints one `Aborted.` line on stderr and
  exits 1 — no Python traceback, and no silent exit 130 for Ctrl-C mid-command.
  Genuine bugs still print their traceback.
- CLI onboarding redesigned (#940). `stash signin` walks a first-run wizard
  that can be re-run anytime with the new `stash setup` — no answer is final.
  Session recording is framed as private-by-default and on by default
  (`stash stop` pauses). The agent picker uses `[x]` checkboxes where enter
  toggles and a `Done` row saves. `stash connect` works in any folder — a git
  repo is no longer required. History import runs in the background via the
  new `stash import-history` (parallel uploads; `--status` attaches a live
  progress bar). Re-uploading a transcript for a deleted session now reports
  a clean skip instead of a 404 error, and no longer pollutes plugin upload
  health.
- `stash memory` is now a command group (#941): `stash memory write "<Path>"`
  creates or updates a Memory wiki page (stdin for long bodies) and
  `stash memory ls` prints the wiki tree — the direct write surface for
  agents that maintain the wiki themselves. Bare `stash memory` and
  `--recompute` are unchanged.
- The nightly cloud Memory curator has an off switch (#942):
  `stash memory --curator off|on`, also surfaced in the web curator panel.
  On-demand recomputes keep working while it's off.
- Scheduled agent run history now reports each run's status, error, duration,
  event count, and tool count while preserving the chronological transcript
  feed used by the agent workspace.
- Scheduled agent runs no longer crash in local dev mode: the MCP registry's
  `.mcp.json` is now written to the local simulated workdir instead of the
  literal `/home/sprite/work` path, which is unwritable on dev machines.
- Gong call documents now link back to the original call in Gong.
- `stash vfs stat` once again shows the source-sharing command for connected
  source roots, including roots that do not have an app URL.
- OAuth reconnects now require a stable provider account identity. Slack,
  Asana, Jira, Linear, Notion, and Gong connections refuse to store new
  credentials when identity lookup fails, preventing retained source data
  from silently continuing under a different provider account.
- Frontend server-side backend requests now require `BACKEND_INTERNAL_URL`
  or `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` instead of guessing an environment, so missing
  managed deploy config fails during build rather than crashing public
  Stash pages at runtime.
- Added a committed `docker-compose.local.yml` override for laptop
  self-hosting dry runs. It exposes backend, frontend, and collab on
  localhost ports and disables Caddy.
- Self-hosting now uses a prebuilt `ghcr.io/fergana-labs/stash-frontend`
  image alongside the backend and collab images, so
  `docker-compose.prod.yml` no longer builds application containers on the
  target machine.
- Backend now routes markdown and HTML uploads to the pages table on the
  one upload endpoint, so every surface (frontend drag-drop, CLI `stash
  files upload`, MCP `stash_upload_file`) gets the same behavior. The
  response is a discriminated `{kind, ...}` payload — `kind: "page"` for
  md/html, `kind: "file"` for everything else.
- MCP server gained ten tools to reach parity with the CLI on agent-
  useful surfaces: discover (`stash_search_public_stashes`,
  `stash_read_public_stash`), page search (`stash_search_pages`),
  session ops (`stash_session_transcript`, `stash_delete_session`),
  invite management (`stash_create_invite`, `stash_revoke_invite`),
  stash access control (`stash_set_stash_access`), and table tooling
  (`stash_update_table`, `stash_export_table`).
- Renamed the three unprefixed MCP tools to share the `stash_` prefix
  with the rest of the surface: `stash_list_trash`, `stash_restore`,
  `stash_purge`.
- Added `BACKEND_INTERNAL_URL` env var so docker / self-host deployments
  route the Next.js server-side fetches at the in-network backend
  hostname instead of looping through the public URL. Public Stash pages
  no longer 500 on a fresh self-host boot.
- Added `INTEGRATIONS_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`,
  `ANTHROPIC_MODEL`, and `ANTHROPIC_FAST_MODEL` to `.env.example` —
  every variable `backend/config.py` actually reads is now in the
  reference file.
- Refreshed user-facing docs (`README`, `ARCHITECTURE`, `USE_CASES`,
  `DESIGN`, the `frontend/docs/*` pages) to match shipped product
  surface: real concept names, real CLI commands, real container set
  for self-hosting.
- Bumped the Claude Code plugin to 0.1.84 so the cached
  SessionStart context refreshes — older versions injected
  `stash history *` / `stash notebooks list` references to commands
  that no longer exist.
- Added `stash vfs`, an app-level virtual filesystem shell for browsing
  Stash with bash-shaped commands and editing existing writable pages.
- Kept `stash mount` hidden as experimental spike code; the supported
  production path is `stash vfs`.
- The developer console now routes the shared wiki per project. Sessions are
  grouped by the project they are filed under and each project carries a
  shared-wiki switch that starts OFF. A project that is off contributes nothing
  to the shared wiki, not even from users who opted in, so material filed under
  a project stops informing it until you clear that project. Unfiled sessions
  and Default-folder sessions keep routing exactly as before, and a user who
  opted out stays out whatever a project says.
