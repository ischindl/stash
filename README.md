## How it works

- **Sessions stream in automatically.** A hook for your coding agent pushes every transcript — prompts, tool calls, artifacts — into your Stash.
- **Files and sessions live side by side.** Markdown, HTML, tables, PDFs. You and your agents both write here; both sides see edits in real time.
- **Agents query it like a filesystem.** A CLI, MCP server (~70 read/write tools), REST API, and virtual-filesystem shell expose your Stash to any agent. One search spans your pages, sessions, and every connected source at once.
- **There's an agent in the box too.** Chat with an agent that already has all of this — in the app, from Slack, or from Telegram. It's a real coding-agent CLI (Claude Code, Codex, opencode, or pi) running on your own cloud VM, so it can read, write, and run things. Give it a cron and it becomes a scheduled agent.
- **Memory is a wiki an agent keeps for you.** A scheduled curator reads whatever is new since its last run — sessions, files, saves — and compiles it into linked pages: entities, concepts, and a running log. It writes only inside the reserved Memory folder, and never reads its own output.
- **Skills are the shareable slice.** A Skill is just a folder with a `SKILL.md` in it — put the pages, files, and tables that belong together in one folder and it becomes shareable as a unit. Publish it to the world, fork a public Skill into your own Stash, or `stash skills install` one into your agent — installed skills auto-update at session start, and `stash skills follow` auto-installs skills people share with you.
- **Bring your own MCP servers.** Register MCP servers once (Tools page or `stash tools add`); your cloud agent gets them automatically and `stash tools install` writes them into any local agent's `.mcp.json`.

## Why persistent beats per-session

When you run Claude on a repo, you generate valuable session transcripts. However, your coding agent can only access transcripts generated on the machine where the agent is currently running. As a result, work is duplicated and velocity is decreased. This is especially true as coding agents begin to run autonomously for significant periods of time.

With Stash, every agent run has context about every session you've created. Here are some use cases:

- **Code Faster / Don't Duplicate Work**: "Have I tried fixing the memory leak in our API gateway before? What was attempted?"
- **Stay Organized**: "What did I get done this week? What other work did I do that isn't tracked in Git?"
- **Recover Lost Context**: "Why did I increase the timeout to 30s? The git history is unhelpful."
- **Pick Up Where You Left Off**: "Please add a feedback endpoint to our API" -> Claude: "FYI, you decided earlier not to add a feedback endpoint since we want to encourage churned users to hop on a call directly"

> "raw data from a given number of sources is collected, then compiled by an LLM into a .md knowledge base, then operated on by various CLIs by the LLM to do Q&A and to incrementally enhance it… **I think there is room here for an incredible new product instead of a hacky collection of scripts.**"
>
> — Andrej Karpathy, *LLM Knowledge Bases*

**Stash is that product.** The one place your agents connect to all your data, with an agent-native Drive they write it back into — not a stack of shell scripts wrapped around a folder of markdown.

Built for —

| Use case | What teams put in it |
|---|---|
| **Engineering live docs** | coding-agent plans, ADRs, and design notes that stay current |
| **Second brain** | the persistent context every one of your agents reads from |
| **Research knowledge base** | long-running PKBs with sources, transcripts, and tables |
| **Ops playbooks** | release runbooks and on-call procedures |
| **Brand voice** | editorial guidelines and copy standards agents write to |
| **Personal knowledge management** | notes, drafts, and scratch files for a single operator |

## Quick Start

```bash
uv tool install stashai
stash signin
```

`stash signin` authenticates you in the browser, then walks first-run setup:
session recording (on by default — pause anytime with `stash stop`), which
coding agents to record, Stash instructions for the folder you're standing in
(any folder — a git repo isn't required), and a background import of the
conversations you've already had (`stash import-history --status` follows it
live). Re-run the wizard anytime with `stash setup`; use `stash connect` from
any other project folder to set it up for Stash.

<details>
<summary>Prefer a one-liner?</summary>

```bash
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://joinstash.ai/install)"
```

The installer uses `uv` to install or update `stashai`, bootstrapping `uv`
when needed, and then runs `stash signin`.
Use this when you don't already have a Python toolchain on your machine.

</p>

Then try it: ask your coding agent if it has access to Stash.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/assets/agent-access.png" alt="Coding agent confirming access to the Stash CLI" width="900" />
</p>

Agents can browse Stash with an app-level virtual filesystem shell:

```bash
stash vfs ls /
stash vfs "tree / -L 2"
stash vfs "find / -maxdepth 3 -type f | head -n 20"
stash vfs "rg \"database migration\" /"
```

## Connected sources

Connect a source once and every agent you point at Stash can read and search it.

| Source | What lands in your Stash |
|---|---|
| **GitHub** | Repo contents, indexed for search — one repo, a pick-list, or every repo you can see |
| **Google Drive** | Your Drive, searchable by name and path; pick a folder to extract full contents (PDFs and scans included) |
| **Gmail** | Recent mail, with search federated live to Gmail. Multiple mailboxes supported |
| **Slack** | Messages from the channels you choose, filed as a transcript per channel per day |
| **Notion** | Pages and database rows as Markdown |
| **Linear** / **Jira** / **Asana** | Issues and tasks, indexed by team, project, or board section |
| **Granola** | Meeting notes and transcripts |
| **PostHog** | Dashboards, insights, feature flags, and experiments |
| **X** | Your bookmarks, posts, replies, and articles — with thread context and media archived |
| **Instagram** | Saved posts and reels, captured by the browser extension |

You can also drop in an **Obsidian vault**, and the **Chrome extension** adds a
web clipper, a bookmark importer, YouTube transcripts, and your ChatGPT and
Claude.ai conversations.

Slack and Linear push changes to Stash over webhooks; everything else syncs on a
schedule. Pick Slack's channels yourself — nothing is indexed until you do.

## Coding agents

Stash supports the following coding agents:
- **Claude Code** 
- **Cursor** 
- **Codex** 
- **OpenCode**
- **Gemini CLI**
- **Openclaw** 
- **Hermes**

Stash supports opt in per-coding agent. `stash signin` detects every agent on your machine and auto-installs its hooks — pick which ones during signin. Mix and match — different teammates can use different agents against the same shared brain. (Openclaw's code scanner requires its unsafe-install flag, which the installer passes; Hermes asks you to approve the hooks once via `hermes hooks list`.)

## CLI Reference

See [here](https://www.joinstash.ai/docs/cli) for a CLI reference.

## Self-Hosted

Run Stash with prebuilt GHCR images:

To host locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Fergana-Labs/stash.git
cd stash
cp .env.example .env
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml -f docker-compose.local.yml pull
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml -f docker-compose.local.yml up -d
curl http://localhost:3456/health
open http://localhost:3457/login
```

Docker Compose generates and persists the OAuth token encryption key when
`INTEGRATIONS_ENCRYPTION_KEY` is unset. Set it yourself only if you manage
deployment secrets outside Compose.

For a public domain with Caddy and HTTPS:

```bash
# Set PUBLIC_URL and CORS_ORIGINS in .env, then replace app.example.com in Caddyfile.
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml pull
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
curl https://app.example.com/health
```

`docker-compose.prod.yml` pins the image versions it was tested with. To
upgrade, pull the latest compose file and restart:

```bash
git pull
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml -f docker-compose.local.yml pull
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml -f docker-compose.local.yml up -d
```

Then install the CLI:

```bash
uv tool install stashai
stash signin --api http://localhost:3456
```

For a domain-backed install, pass your public URL instead (e.g.
`stash signin --api https://app.example.com`). To change the endpoint later,
run `stash settings`.

Finally see it in action:

```
claude
> what did I get done last week? check stash.
```

## Privacy

Stash is built for engineering teams working in private repos.

- **LLM calls are optional and scoped.** An Anthropic key powers ask-the-stash, session titles, and OCR for scanned PDFs; the chat agent runs on Anthropic, OpenAI, or OpenRouter with your own key, or on your own local model endpoint. Without any of them, the rest of Stash works — those features are simply unavailable.
- **Private by default.** Your Stash is yours alone. Content becomes public only when you make it so: publishing a Skill, creating a public link to a page, file, folder, or table, or posting to the pastebin.
- **Recording is yours to control.** Session recording is on by default during setup, and every control is one command away: decline it in the wizard, pause globally with `stash stop`, pick which agents record, or exclude folders in `stash settings`. Saying no still gives your agent *read* access to your Stash — nothing about using Stash requires uploading your own sessions.
  
## FAQ

**What LLMs does Stash use?**
An Anthropic key covers ask-the-stash, session titles, and scanned-PDF OCR. The chat agent is separate and runs whichever harness you point it at — Claude Code, Codex, opencode, or pi — against your own Anthropic, OpenAI, OpenRouter, or local-model endpoint. Embeddings are a third, independent choice (OpenAI, HuggingFace, or a local model). All of it is optional; without any keys the rest of Stash works and those features are disabled.

**What writes to my Stash on its own?**
One thing by default: the Memory curator, a scheduled agent that compiles your Memory wiki from new sessions and files. It only writes inside the reserved Memory folder, and it only reads what's new since its last run. Turn the nightly run off or on with `stash memory --curator off|on` (on-demand runs keep working). Beyond that, nothing runs unless you create it — any agent you give a cron to becomes a scheduled agent, and those have the same reach you do.

**Can I use this without Claude Code?**
Yes. You can use the CLI with anything, and Stash has native plugins for Cursor, Codex, Opencode, Gemini CLI, and more.
